# PowerBi-Movies
Using the Movies Dataset I was able to first clean remove and drop missing values in the dataset to create a clean dataset and import it as a CSV file to be uploaded to the PowerBi software. I explored these following questions whilst also making my own visualizations to the PowerBi dashboard. 
My questions were:
1. The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre​
2. The number of movies produced per year ​
3. The audience score for each film  ​
4. The profitability per studio ​
5. The worldwide gross per genre
6. Sum of gross by year and genre in 2008/2009
7. Sum of Profitabilty by Animation Genre
